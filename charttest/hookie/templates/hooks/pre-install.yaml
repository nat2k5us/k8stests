  # This shows how to use a simple value. This will look for a passed-in value
  # called restartPolicy. If it is not found, it will use the default value.
  # {{default "Never" .restartPolicy}} is a slightly optimized version of the
  # more conventional syntax: {{.restartPolicy | default "Never"}}
  restartPolicy: "Never"
